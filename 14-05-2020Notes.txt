- Global variables are declared outside the function.

Ex:
var x;
let y;
const z = 30;
function f1() {
  x=10;
  y=20;
  console.log(`Function-1 X=${x} Y=${y} Z=${z}`);
}
function f2() {
  x=20;
  y=30;
  console.log(`Function-2 X=${x} Y=${y} Z=${z}`);
}
f1();
f2();

FAQ: Can I declare any variable inside function with global scope?
A. Yes. Global variables inside a function a defined by using "window" object, which you can test only in HTML page.

Ex:
<script>
    function f1() {
        window.x = 10;
    }
    function f2() {
        document.write("x in f2 " + x);
    }
    f1();
    f2();
</script>

- Variable Naming Conventions
    a) Variable name must start with an alphabet or 
         underscore. It can't start with numeric or any
         other special chars.

	let  price = 2300.44;		valid
	let  _price = 34000.44;	valid
	let price_  = 34000.44;	valid
	let price_12 = 34500.55; 	valid
	let 12_price = 45000.55; 	invalid
	let price12 = 3400.44;	valid

   b) Variable name can't be more than 255 chars long.
   c)  Always use cameCase for naming variables.

	  txtPassword
	  txt  [prefix] 	- must define object
	  Password [suffix]   - purpose of object

    d) Variable name must speak what it is.

	              Data Types
- In Computer programming the "type" was introduced in early 1976 by Parnas, Shore & Weiss.
- Type Related to Representation and Behavior
- Type is also related to value space.
- Started with ALGOL, Pascal, Simula and CLU.

Definition: Technically data type determines the type of value stored in memory reference. It configures the behavior, space and representaiton.

- JavaScript is implicitly typed.
- TypeScript is explicitly typed.

       let variableName : type ;
- Typescript  "any" type is considered as the Root type for all datatypes.
- All datatypes used in typescript are derived from "any".
- The typescript data types are categorized into 2 Groups
	1. Primitive Types
	2. Non-Primitive Types

Note: Type are categorized into 6 types as per Data Structures
	a) Abstract data types
	b) Metaclass
	c) Primitive Types
	d) Statistical data types
	e) String
	f) Tree structures

Primitive Types:
- The range of primitive data type is avilable and depended on the specific programming language.
- Primitive types use a memory stack for storing values.
- A Stack memory uses LIFO.
- They have a fixed range for values
- Always values fall between mix and max or have a specific value in memory.

     ex: 
	byte     8-bits    -128 to +127    0 to 255
	            16-bits  -32768 to +32767  0-65535
- Primitive type are pre-defined for language.
- Built-in types are know as primitive.
- TypeScript primitive types are
	a) number
	b) boolean
	c) string
	d) null
	e) undefined
