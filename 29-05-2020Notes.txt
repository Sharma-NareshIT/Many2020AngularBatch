4. in operator: It is a special operator used to verify whether the given property is a member of specified object. It returns boolean true or false.


 Syntax:
	"PropertyName"  in ObjectName

Ex:
let product:any = {
    Name: 'TV',
    Price: 45000.55,
    InStock: true,
}
console.log(`Is Qty a member of Product ? ${"Qty" in product}`);
console.log(`Is Price a member of Product ? ${"Price" in product}`);

Ex: You can use "in" operator with for statement to create an iterator for properties. So that you can read all properties of an object.
	      
let product:any = {
    Name: 'TV',
    Price: 45000.55,
    InStock: true,
}
for(var property in product) {
    console.log(`${property}:${product[property]}`);
}

5. of  operator:  It is a special operator, which can be used only over an iteration to read all values from a collection.

Ex:
let products:any[] = [
    {
        Name: 'TV',
        Price: 45000.55,
        InStock: true,
    },
    {
        Name: "Mobile",
        Price: 12000.33,
        InStock:false
    }
];
for(var value of products) {
    console.log(value);
}

6. new operator: It is dynamic memory allocating operator.
	           It allocates memory for any specific type	
	           of object and loads its members into 
	           memory.

  Syntax:
	let  mfd:any = new Date();
                 let products:string[] = new Array();

	
	              TypeScript Statements
	              ===================
- Statement is a program instruction used to control the execution flow.
- Statements are classified into following types


Category			Keywords
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selection Statements	if, else, switch, case, default
Iteration and Looping	for, while, do while
Jump Statements		break, continue, return
Exception Handling		try, catch, throw, finally


Selection Statements
a) Forward Jump	     if(condition){ }
b) Single Condition       if() { } else { }
c) Multiple Conditions  if() { } else if () { } else { }
d) Multi Level Conditions  if(){ if() { }else{} } else { }
e) Switch Selection

 	             What is a switch?
In electronics switch is used to interrupt the flow of electrons.
There are various types of switches 
	a) Toggle switch
	b) Push button
	c) JoyStick switch
	d) Selector Switch

Iteration and Looping :

Iterator is a software design pattern used to read elements from a collection in sequential order. It is under "Software Behavioral Patterns". It is a communication pattern.
Ex:
	for..in,  for..of

Looping is the process of executing a set of statements repetedly until the given condition is satisfied.

Ex:   for(), while, do while

What is Recursion?
- It is a technique where a function call is defined with in the context of same function.
- It executes the same function repeatedly until the condition satisfied.
- It is without loop or iteration.

Ex:
function factorial(n:number){ 
   if(n<=0) {
       return 1;
   } else {
       return n * (factorial(n-1));
   }
}
console.log(`Factorial of 5 is ${factorial(7)}`);
